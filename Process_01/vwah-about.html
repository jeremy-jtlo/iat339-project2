                <h2>RED's little box of value</h2>
                <p>RED is a company founded by two individuals finishing up their University degree. To keep their secret identities safe, we will assume that they are V and J. V once told J that during brainstorming sessions, he sometimes lacked creative input, but after having a few delicious drinks, he'd get a sudden surge of excellent ideas. V thought that it would be good to replicate this same side-effect, but without the after-effects of consuming delicious drinks. J promptly agreed and they both worked together to create the first ever creative pill, Red Pill!
                <br><br>
                However, Red Pill had one issue, it was a permanent effect! V and J had rework their business model and decided to sell another exclusive pill that would help resolve Red Pill's effect. Thus the duo created Blue Pill! Now whenever there were sales on the Red Pill, there would also be sales on the Blue Pill! This innovative business model was adopted by the fruit company Apple and thus, they too have tricked millions.
